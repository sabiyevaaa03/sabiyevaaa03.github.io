                    <div className='newsBlockText2'>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</div>
                        </div>

                <div className='newsBlockImg5'>
                    <div className='newsBlockText5'>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
                     content here', making it look like readable English.</div>

                     and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. </div>
